# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews
The main objective of our project is to accurately extract peopleâ€™s opinions from a large number of unstructured review texts and classify them into either positive or negative review.
Thus, we have created a binary classification machine learning model(positive/negative) for customer reviews received by the restaurant.
Restaurants can see their overall performance by seeing number of positive and negative reviews and can improve them.
They can also make their customer support team to call back customers who gave negative reviews and resolve their issues.
